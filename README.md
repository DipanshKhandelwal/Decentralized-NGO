# Decentralized-NGO

  A decentralized application (Dapp, dApp or DApp) is an application that is run by many
  users on a decentralized network with trustless protocols. 

 They are designed to avoid any single point of failure. They typically have tokens to reward users for providing computing power.
 Decentralized applications may run on top of other cryptographic systems such as <b>Ethereum</b>.

#<b>Ethereum</b>

Ethereum is an open-source, public, blockchain-based distributed computing platform and operating system featuring smart contract (scripting) functionality.[3] It supports a modified version of Nakamoto consensus via transaction-based state transitions.

Ether is a cryptocurrency whose blockchain is generated by the Ethereum platform. Ether can be transferred between accounts and used to compensate participant mining nodes for computations performed.[4] Ethereum provides a decentralized Turing-complete virtual machine, the Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM), which can execute scripts using an international network of public nodes. 
"Gas", an internal transaction pricing mechanism, is used to mitigate spam and allocate resources on the network.

# To run a react app on Ethereum, follow below steps:
1. First install Truffle.
   Truffle is a development and testing framework for Ethereum with which you can compile, test and deploy smart contracts on Ethereum network.
